# Title: Data Analysis using Google Colab

This repository contains data analysis projects completed using Google Colab. The goal is to provide a central location for storing and sharing these analyses, and to encourage further exploration and collaboration.

## Project 1: Analyzing Movie Ratings

This project focuses on analyzing movie ratings data from a Kaggle dataset. The analysis includes:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicate entries and filtering based on rating values.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing the distribution of ratings, identifying the most popular genres, and calculating average ratings for different genres.
* **Modeling:** Building a simple linear regression model to predict movie ratings based on features like budget and popularity.

## Project 2: Predicting Stock Prices

This project utilizes historical stock price data to build a basic prediction model. The analysis involves:

* **Data Import:** Downloading and preprocessing stock price data using the yfinance library.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features like moving averages and momentum indicators.
* **Model Training:** Training a simple moving average crossover strategy and evaluating its performance.

## Future Work

We plan to add more data analysis projects to this repository, covering a variety of topics and datasets. These projects will showcase the capabilities of Google Colab for data analysis and visualization.

We encourage contributions from the community. If you have an interesting data analysis project that you would like to share, please feel free to submit a pull request.
